// Once upon a time, a [giant] air-breathing [Kraken] that came from the ocean [began] to attack a city.
// A tiny boy ate 10 radioactive spiders and 5 radioactive (user input), so he ate 5 + 10 = 15 things.
// He turned into Superman or something, then attacked the Kraken.
// The prophecy that the boy would defeat the Kraken was [false].
// The Kraken slammed the boy into a building, crushed him, and destroyed the city.
