Overview:
In this assignment, you will create a simple MadLibs themed program using JavaScript. The goal is to practice using variables, different data types, and basic operations in JavaScript. You'll create a story by filling in the blanks with words and numbers stored in variables, and then output the final story using console.log().

Submit: link to your github repo
Requirements:
Create a new Github repository and open it in Codespaces
Create a script.js file and an index.html file. link the script.js file to the html  file

a word (e.g., a noun, verb, adjective).

a value entered by the user using prompt 
Create a short story (at least 2-3 sentences) using these variables. The story should make sense even if it's silly or whimsical.
Concatenate your variables into a single string that forms a complete sentence or sentences.

Use console.log() to output the concatenated string with your story to the console.
